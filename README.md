# Facial-Recognition-Security-
A compact access control system built with Arduino and facial recognition. This project captures and analyzes facial data to grant or deny entryâ€”no keys, no cards, just your face. User will sit in frame of camera and if their face is recognized in the system it will grant access, if not they will be denied. Uses a Google Teachable Model for the facial recognition.
