# Facial-Recognition-Security-
A compact access control system built with Arduino and facial recognition. This project captures and analyzes facial data to grant or deny entry—no keys, no cards, just your face. User will sit in frame of camera and if their face is recognized in the system it will grant access and blink the green light on the Arduino, if not they will be denied and blink the red light on the Arduino. Uses a Google Teachable Model for the facial recognition.
